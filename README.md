# Segnet-Transfer-Learning
This project is based on the Python language, the Keras deep learning framework, migration learning techniques and the tensorboard module to build a SegNet neural network, documenting the training process.

# Installation
tensorflow-gpu==1.13.1

keras==2.1.5

# Run project
You can use our trained deep learning models for semantic segmentation prediction of city street images.

1.Place your prepared street view images in the ***img*** folder.

2.Change the image read path in ***<predict.py>***.

3.Run ***<predict.py>*** for semantic segmentation of street view image.

4.The results are saved in the ***imgout*** folder.

# Download the cityscapes dataset
The Cityscapes is an open data set that can be downloaded from the official website.
